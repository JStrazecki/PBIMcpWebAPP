# FastMCP Implementation for Power BI MCP Server

## Overview

This implementation uses FastMCP 2.0, a modern Python framework specifically designed for building MCP servers. FastMCP provides better compatibility with Claude.ai and other MCP clients.

## Why FastMCP?

1. **Designed for MCP**: Built specifically for the Model Context Protocol
2. **Multiple Transport Support**: Native support for HTTP, SSE, and stdio transports
3. **Better Claude Compatibility**: Used successfully by the MCP community
4. **Production Ready**: Includes authentication, deployment tools, and monitoring
5. **Active Development**: FastMCP is actively maintained and updated

## Architecture

### Files Created

1. **mcp_fastmcp_server.py**
   - Main FastMCP server implementation
   - Uses decorators for clean tool definitions
   - Async support for better performance
   - Built-in initialization handlers

2. **mcp_asgi_app.py**
   - ASGI wrapper for Azure deployment
   - Configures HTTP transport
   - Compatible with gunicorn + uvicorn

### Key Features

- **HTTP Transport**: Using Streamable HTTP (recommended for web deployments)
- **ASGI Compatible**: Works with gunicorn using uvicorn workers
- **OAuth Ready**: Still uses the same OAuth flow for Claude.ai
- **Same Tools**: All 4 Power BI tools implemented with FastMCP decorators

## Deployment Configuration

### Procfile Updated
```
web: gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --timeout 600 --access-logfile - --error-logfile - --log-level info mcp_asgi_app:application
```

### Requirements Updated
- Added `uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0` for ASGI worker support
- Already had `fastmcp>=0.1.0` in requirements

## FastMCP Advantages

1. **Protocol Compliance**: FastMCP handles all MCP protocol details automatically
2. **Error Handling**: Built-in error management and logging
3. **Transport Flexibility**: Easy to switch between HTTP, SSE, and stdio
4. **Tool Discovery**: FastMCP may handle tool discovery differently, potentially fixing Claude.ai issues

## Testing the New Implementation

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test with stdio transport (default)
python mcp_fastmcp_server.py

# Test with HTTP transport
MCP_TRANSPORT=http python mcp_fastmcp_server.py

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}'
```

### Azure Deployment
The server will automatically use HTTP transport on Azure due to the environment configuration in mcp_asgi_app.py.

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Protocol Handling**: FastMCP is designed specifically for MCP
2. **Tool Discovery**: May handle the tools/list issue better
3. **Connection Stability**: Built-in connection management
4. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and recovery

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Azure
2. Test with Claude.ai Enterprise
3. Monitor logs for any protocol differences
4. Check if tools become available
