# MCP-Claude.ai Connection Troubleshooting Log

## Issue Summary
Claude.ai returns error: "There was an error connecting to test. Please check your server URL handles auth correctly."

## What We Know Works
1. ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
2. ✅ OAuth discovery endpoints return 200 OK with correct "no auth required" responses
3. ✅ MCP protocol endpoint works with proper headers and clientInfo
4. ✅ Server is running and accessible

## Claude.ai Connection Flow (from logs)
1. HEAD / → 200 OK
2. GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource → 200 OK
3. GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server → 200 OK (twice)
4. POST / → 307 Redirect to /mcp/
5. **Connection fails here**

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. OAuth Discovery Endpoints (✅ Implemented)
**What**: Added OAuth discovery endpoints that indicate no auth required
**Result**: Claude.ai successfully queries these (200 OK)
**Status**: Working but not sufficient

### 2. HTTPS URL Fix (✅ Implemented)
**What**: Fixed OAuth endpoints to return https:// URLs using x-forwarded-proto
**Result**: Endpoints return correct URLs
**Status**: Deployed but Claude.ai still fails

### 3. Root POST Redirect (❌ Not Working)
**What**: Changed root POST to redirect to /mcp/ with 307 status
**Result**: Claude.ai doesn't follow the redirect
**Status**: Failed - Claude.ai appears to not follow redirects

### 4. Root POST Proxy (✅ Implemented)
**What**: Root POST endpoint now proxies requests to /mcp/ internally
**Features**:
- Automatically adds missing clientInfo for initialize requests
- Preserves all headers and body
- Returns MCP response directly without redirect
**Status**: Ready for deployment

### 4. Missing clientInfo Parameter
**Issue**: FastMCP requires clientInfo but Claude.ai doesn't send it
**Impact**: Even if we get to /mcp/, initialization will fail
**Status**: Unresolved - FastMCP limitation

## Next Steps to Try

### Option 1: Make Root Endpoint Handle MCP Protocol
Instead of redirecting, make the root endpoint proxy MCP requests directly.

### Option 2: Use stdio Transport Instead
FastMCP supports stdio transport which might have different validation.

### Option 3: Custom MCP Implementation
Build a minimal MCP server without FastMCP's strict validation.

## Key Insights
1. Claude.ai expects MCP protocol on the root URL
2. Claude.ai doesn't follow HTTP redirects
3. FastMCP's validation is too strict for Claude.ai's requests
4. The auth error message is misleading - it's actually a protocol mismatch

## Configuration That Should Work
- URL in Claude.ai: `https://pbimcp.azurewebsites.net`
- No authentication
- Server must handle MCP protocol on root endpoint
- Server must accept initialize without clientInfo
