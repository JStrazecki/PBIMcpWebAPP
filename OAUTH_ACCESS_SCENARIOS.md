# 🔐 OAuth Access Scenarios - Power BI Workspace Permissions

## 🎯 Key Question: Who Controls Access?

**Answer: The USER controls access, not the App Registration!**

With **delegated permissions**, your MCP server acts **on behalf of the user** using their credentials and permissions. The app registration only defines what *types* of actions are allowed, but the user's actual permissions determine what they can see.

## 📊 Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: App Registration vs User Permissions
```
App Registration Access: Workspaces A, B
User Permission: Workspace A only
Result: User sees ONLY Workspace A ✅
```

**Why?** 
- App registration grants *capability* to read workspaces
- User's actual permissions *limit* what they can access
- MCP server uses user's token → user sees only what they own/have access to

### Scenario 2: User Has More Access Than App Registration
```
App Registration Access: Workspace A only  
User Permission: Workspaces A, B, C
Result: User sees ONLY Workspace A ✅
```

**Why?**
- App registration limits the *scope* of possible actions
- User cannot exceed app registration permissions
- Intersection of (App Permissions ∩ User Permissions) = Final Access

## 🔒 Permission Matrix

| App Registration | User Permission | Final Access | Explanation |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Workspaces A, B, C | Workspace A | **Workspace A** | User limited by their own access |
| Workspace A | Workspaces A, B | **Workspace A** | User limited by app scope |
| Workspaces A, B | None | **None** | User has no workspace access |
| None | Workspaces A, B | **None** | App has no workspace permissions |
| Workspaces A, B | Workspaces B, C | **Workspace B** | Intersection of both permissions |

## 🏗️ How OAuth Delegation Works

### 1. App Registration Permissions (Scope Definition)
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "Dataset.Read.All",
    "Report.Read.All", 
    "Workspace.Read.All"
  ],
  "role": "Defines what TYPES of actions are allowed"
}
```

### 2. User Authentication (Actual Access)
```json
{
  "user": "john.doe@company.com",
  "workspaces": ["Sales Dashboard", "Marketing Reports"],
  "role": "Determines WHICH specific resources user can access"
}
```

### 3. MCP Server On-Behalf-Of Flow
```
User Token → MCP Server → Power BI API
     ↓           ↓            ↓
User's actual → Acts as → Returns only user's
permissions     user       accessible data
```

## ✅ Security Benefits

### 1. **User-Centric Security**
- Users cannot see workspaces they don't have access to
- No privilege escalation possible
- Each user gets their own isolated view

### 2. **App Registration as Guardrails**
- Defines maximum possible permissions
- Prevents unauthorized action types
- Admin controls what the app can do

### 3. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Final access = MIN(App Permissions, User Permissions)
- Users cannot exceed their normal Power BI access
- App cannot grant additional permissions

## 🧪 Testing Access Control

### Test Scenario 1: Limited User Access
```bash
# User with access to only "Sales" workspace
USER_TOKEN="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc..."

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
     https://pbimcp.azurewebsites.net/mcp/list_powerbi_workspaces

# Expected Result:
{
  "workspaces": [
    {"name": "Sales Dashboard", "id": "12345"}
  ]
  # Marketing and Finance workspaces NOT visible
}
```

### Test Scenario 2: Admin User Access
```bash
# Admin user with access to all workspaces
ADMIN_TOKEN="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhZG1..."

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     https://pbimcp.azurewebsites.net/mcp/list_powerbi_workspaces

# Expected Result:
{
  "workspaces": [
    {"name": "Sales Dashboard", "id": "12345"},
    {"name": "Marketing Reports", "id": "67890"},  
    {"name": "Finance Analytics", "id": "54321"}
  ]
  # All workspaces visible (up to app registration limits)
}
```

## 🚨 Common Misconceptions

### ❌ **Wrong**: "App registration grants workspace access"
- App registration only defines permission *types*
- Cannot grant access to specific workspaces
- Users must already have Power BI workspace permissions

### ✅ **Correct**: "App registration enables delegation"  
- App can read workspaces *on behalf of user*
- User's existing permissions determine what they see
- App acts as a proxy using user's credentials

### ❌ **Wrong**: "All users see the same workspaces"
- Each user has their own unique permissions
- MCP server returns user-specific results
- No shared or elevated access

### ✅ **Correct**: "Each user sees their own workspaces"
- User A sees only their authorized workspaces
- User B sees only their authorized workspaces  
- Complete data isolation between users

## 🎯 Practical Implications

### For Administrators:
1. **App Registration Setup**: Grant broad permission types (Dataset.Read.All, etc.)
2. **User Management**: Control access via Power BI workspace permissions
3. **No Additional Setup**: Users automatically get appropriate access

### For Users:
1. **Authenticate Once**: Login with their Microsoft account
2. **See Own Data**: Only workspaces they normally access
3. **No Surprises**: Same permissions as Power BI web interface

### For Security:
1. **Zero Trust**: Users cannot access unauthorized data
2. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged under user identity
3. **No Privilege Escalation**: App cannot grant additional permissions

## 📋 Configuration Checklist

### ✅ App Registration Permissions (One-time setup):
```
☑️ Dataset.Read.All (Delegated)
☑️ Report.Read.All (Delegated)  
☑️ Workspace.Read.All (Delegated)
☑️ Admin consent granted
```

### ✅ User Workspace Access (Per-user in Power BI):
```
☑️ User added to workspace as Member/Admin/Contributor
☑️ User has Power BI Pro/Premium license
☑️ User can access workspace in Power BI web interface
```

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
```
☑️ User sees only their authorized workspaces
☑️ Different users see different workspace lists
☑️ No user can access unauthorized data
☑️ App registration permissions are enforced
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Access Issues

### User Can't See Expected Workspace:
1. **Check Power BI Permissions**: Can user see workspace in powerbi.com?
2. **Verify License**: Does user have Power BI Pro/Premium?
3. **Check App Permissions**: Does app registration have Workspace.Read.All?
4. **Admin Consent**: Was admin consent granted for the app?

### User Sees Unexpected Workspaces:
1. **This shouldn't happen** - indicates permission issue
2. **Verify token validation** in MCP server logs
3. **Check for cached tokens** or session issues
4. **Test with fresh authentication**

## 🎉 Summary

**Your OAuth implementation provides perfect multi-tenant security:**

- ✅ **User A** connects → sees only their workspaces
- ✅ **User B** connects → sees only their workspaces  
- ✅ **Admin** connects → sees all their authorized workspaces
- ✅ **Client isolation** automatically enforced
- ✅ **No configuration needed** per client/user

**The beauty of delegated permissions**: Users get exactly what they already have access to in Power BI, nothing more, nothing less! 🔐✨
