# ðŸš¨ STARTUP LOG DIAGNOSIS - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

## Issues Identified from Your Azure Logs:

### 1. **Windows Line Ending Problem** âœ… FIXED
**Lines 147-154 in logs:**
```
startup.sh: line 8: $'\r': command not found
startup.sh: line 9: cd: $'/home/site/wwwroot\r': No such file or directory
startup.sh: line 50: syntax error: unexpected end of file
```
**Fix Applied:** Converted startup.sh to Unix line endings with `dos2unix`

### 2. **Container Termination After Successful Startup** ðŸš¨ CRITICAL
**Lines 169-178 in logs:**
```
Site startup probe succeeded after 78.7333155 seconds.
Site started.
Container is terminating. Grace period: 5 seconds.
Site: pbimcp stopped.
```

**This means:**
- Your app container **DID start successfully**
- But it **terminated immediately after** 
- This suggests your Python app crashed or exited after startup

### 3. **Missing Python App Logs** ðŸš¨ CRITICAL
**Expected but missing:**
- No FastMCP initialization logs
- No Flask app startup logs  
- No MCP server ready messages

**This suggests:** Your Python app never started or crashed immediately

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION:

### Use Direct Gunicorn Command (Bypass startup.sh issues)

**Set this in Azure Portal â†’ Configuration â†’ General Settings â†’ Startup Command:**
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1 --timeout 600 --access-logfile - --error-logfile - --log-level info app:APP
```

**Why this will work better:**
1. âœ… No line ending issues
2. âœ… No bash script complexity  
3. âœ… Direct app startup
4. âœ… Better error logging

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

You should see these logs instead:
```
FastMCP imported successfully
Flask and CORS imported successfully
FastMCP server initialized successfully
Flask app and CORS initialized successfully
=== Power BI MCP Server Direct Startup ===
Power BI MCP Server ready for gunicorn startup
[INFO] Starting gunicorn
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000
[INFO] Using worker: sync
[INFO] Booting worker with pid: [number]
```

## ðŸ”§ NEXT STEPS:

1. **Set direct gunicorn command in Azure Portal**
2. **Restart your Azure Web App**  
3. **Check logs for Python app initialization**
4. **Test your MCP server endpoints**

Your app is properly configured - the issue is just the startup method!
