# Startup Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The Azure App Service startup was failing with:
```
/opt/startup/startup.sh: 23: web:: not found
```

## Root Cause
The Procfile had `web:` prefix which Azure App Service was interpreting as a shell command. Azure App Service doesn't use the Heroku-style `web:` prefix.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Updated Procfile**
   - Removed `web:` prefix from the command
   - Now directly starts with `gunicorn`

2. **Created runtime.txt**
   - Specifies Python 3.11 to match Azure's available runtimes
   - Prevents version mismatch issues

3. **Updated mcp_asgi_app.py**
   - Added sys.path configuration to ensure imports work correctly
   - Prevents module import errors in Azure environment

## Deployment Command
The app will now start with:
```bash
gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --timeout 600 --access-logfile - --error-logfile - --log-level info mcp_asgi_app:application
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Deploy to Azure
3. Monitor startup logs for successful launch
