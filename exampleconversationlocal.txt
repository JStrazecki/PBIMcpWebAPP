I'll help you find your 2024 revenue from your finance model. Let me start by checking what Power BI workspaces you have access to.

I can see you have access to two workspaces: "Onetribe Demo" and "RMC Demo Application". To find your 2024 revenue, I need to know which workspace and dataset contains your finance model. Let me help you select the right model:

I can see several models available. Based on your request for revenue from a "finance model", the most likely candidate is "Onetribe Demo - Model Finance" in the Onetribe Demo workspace. Let me analyze this model to find your 2024 revenue data:

It appears there might be an issue accessing the schema or measures in this model.

Perfect! I can see the finance model structure. I notice there are measures for EBITDA and Gross Profit, but no direct Revenue measure. Let me explore the data to find revenue information. In financial models, revenue is typically found in specific account types. Let me check what accounts are available:

Based on the 4 queries, here's what I understand about your finance model structure:

Tables:

Journals - Fact table containing accounting transactions with P&L and BS movements
Accounts - Dimension table with chart of accounts used in transactions
Contacts - Dimension table with contacts associated with transactions
Mapping - Management mapping to allocate accounts to appropriate categories
_Date - Date dimension table
_Measures - Table containing key model measures
Key Columns:

Account Code and Account Name (from Accounts)
Contact Name and Country (from Contacts)
Date and Fiscal Year (from _Date)
Available Measures:

EBITDA (Income Statement)
Gross Profit (Income Statement)
Gross Profit % (Income Statement)
Relationships:

Journals connects to _Date, Accounts, Contacts, _Scenario, and Sources tables
Accounts connects to Mapping table
Standard star schema structure with Journals as the central fact table
The model structure shows this is a comprehensive financial model with proper dimensional modeling, but I notice there's no direct "Revenue" measure defined in the _Measures table.
