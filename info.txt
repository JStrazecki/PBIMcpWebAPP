Learn how to connect Claude to remote MCP servers and extend its capabilities with internet-hosted tools and data sources

Remote MCP servers extend AI applications’ capabilities beyond your local environment, providing access to internet-hosted tools, services, and data sources. By connecting to remote MCP servers, you transform AI assistants from helpful tools into informed teammates capable of handling complex, multi-step projects with real-time access to external resources.
Many clients now support remote MCP servers, enabling a wide range of integration possibilities. This guide demonstrates how to connect to remote MCP servers using Claude as an example, one of the many clients that support MCP. While we focus on Claude’s implementation through Custom Connectors, the concepts apply broadly to other MCP-compatible clients.
​
Understanding Remote MCP Servers
Remote MCP servers function similarly to local MCP servers but are hosted on the internet rather than your local machine. They expose tools, prompts, and resources that Claude can use to perform tasks on your behalf. These servers can integrate with various services such as project management tools, documentation systems, code repositories, and any other API-enabled service.
The key advantage of remote MCP servers is their accessibility. Unlike local servers that require installation and configuration on each device, remote servers are available from any MCP client with an internet connection. This makes them ideal for web-based AI applications, integrations that emphasize ease-of-use and services that require server-side processing or authentication.
​
What are Custom Connectors?
Custom Connectors serve as the bridge between Claude and remote MCP servers. They allow you to connect Claude directly to the tools and data sources that matter most to your workflows, enabling Claude to operate within your favorite software and draw insights from the complete context of your external tools.
With Custom Connectors, you can:
Connect Claude to existing remote MCP servers provided by third-party developers
Build your own remote MCP servers to connect with any tool
​
Connecting to a Remote MCP Server
The process of connecting Claude to a remote MCP server involves adding a Custom Connector through the Claude interface. This establishes a secure connection between Claude and your chosen remote server.
1
Navigate to Connector Settings

Open Claude in your browser and navigate to the settings page. You can access this by clicking on your profile icon and selecting “Settings” from the dropdown menu. Once in settings, locate and click on the “Connectors” section in the sidebar.

Getting Started with Custom Connectors Using Remote MCP
Updated this week
Custom connectors using remote MCP are available on Claude and Claude Desktop for users on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. This feature is currently in beta.

⚠️ Security and Privacy with Custom Connectors (beta)
Be aware that custom connectors allow you to connect Claude to services that have not been verified by Anthropic, and allow Claude to access and take action in these services. Consider the following to minimize security and privacy risks when using this feature:

Only add and authenticate custom connectors from trusted organizations, listed directly on their websites.

Carefully review Claude's requests to invoke tools, especially for tools that may send data to or take action in external applications.

Only enable the specific tools that are most relevant to your conversation, especially before invoking Research.

Report malicious MCP servers to our vulnerability disclosure program, and choose https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol as the Asset.

In some circumstances, MCP server developers may change their tool’s behavior without warning the user, potentially leading to unexpected or malicious behavior. We attempt to block suspicious MCP tool calls, but we suggest taking precautions to isolate Claude from sensitive data.

 

For more guidance, review the Security and Privacy Considerations section below.

 

What are custom connectors?
Custom connectors let you connect Claude directly to the tools and data sources that matter most to your workflows. This enables Claude to operate within your favorite software and draw insights from the complete context of your external tools.

 

You can:

Connect Claude to existing remote MCP servers.

Build your own remote MCP servers to connect with any tool.

What are remote MCP servers?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard, created by Anthropic, for AI applications to connect to tools and data.

 

Previously, MCP servers only ran locally (i.e. on a user's laptop). Now, developers can build and host remote MCP servers that communicate with AI apps over the internet.

 

Remote MCP servers give models access to internet-hosted tools and data, transforming Claude into an informed teammate that can independently handle complex, multi-step projects tailored to your needs.

 

Getting Started with Custom Connectors
Using Existing Connectors
To get started, choose from the existing connectors listed here. For example, Zapier MCP lets users connect Claude to thousands of apps using Zapier's pre-built connections.

 

Building Connectors
To learn about building connectors to use with Claude, see Building Custom Connectors via Remote MCP Servers.

 

Adding Connectors to Claude
Enterprise and Team plans (Owners and Primary Owners)

Note: While anyone can build and host connectors using remote MCP, only Primary Owners or Owners can enable it on Claude for Work plans (Team and Enterprise). Once a connector has been configured on a Team or Enterprise organization, users individually connect to and enable that connector. This ensures that Claude can only access tools and data that the individual user has access to.

Navigate to Settings > Connectors.

Toggle to "Organization connectors" at the top of the page.

Locate the "Connectors" section.

Click "Add custom connector" at the bottom of the section.

Add your connector's remote MCP server URL.

Finish configuring your connector by clicking "Add."

Pro and Max plans

Navigate to Settings > Connectors.

Locate the "Connectors" section.

Click "Add custom connector" at the bottom of the section.

Add your connector's remote MCP server URL.

Finish configuring your connector by clicking "Add."

Removing or Editing Connectors
You can remove or edit the configuration of your connector:

Navigate to Settings > Connectors.

Locate the "Connectors" section.

Click "Remove" or select the three dots next to the connector you'd like to edit.

Follow the prompts to edit or remove.

Enabling Connectors
You can enable connectors via the “Search and tools” button on the lower left of your chat interface. For connectors that require authentication, click “Connect” to go through the authentication flow and grant permission for Claude to access the service. After connecting, use the same menu to enable or disable specific tools made available by the server. 


 

 

Security and Privacy Considerations
Custom connectors allow you to connect Claude to arbitrary services that have not been verified by Anthropic. When you connect Claude to external services, you're granting it the ability to access and potentially modify data within those services based on your permissions. It’s important to make sure you’re only connecting to remote MCP servers that you trust and that you’re aware of Claude’s interactions with web connectors.

 

Security and Permissions
When you add a custom connector to Claude, you'll typically go through an OAuth authentication process to securely sign in to the application and grant specific permissions. This allows Claude to interact with the application on your behalf, without Claude ever seeing your actual password. You can revoke these permissions at any time by disconnecting the connector in Claude's settings or the third-party service's security settings.

 

Remote MCP servers act as intermediaries between Claude and external applications. You should:

Only connect to trusted servers: Only connect Claude to servers built and hosted by organizations and applications you trust.

Review requested permissions carefully: During auth, review what permissions the MCP server is requesting to the application. Limit these scopes when possible and deny access if requested permissions seem unnecessary.

Be aware of prompt injections: Malicious MCP servers may include hidden instructions that try to make Claude perform unintended actions. Claude has built-in protections that attempt to block these attacks, but it's important to pay attention to tool inputs & outputs and connect only to trusted servers.

Monitor changes in tool behavior: Server developers may update tool behavior unexpectedly, leading to unintended or malicious behavior.

Reporting Malicious MCP Servers
If you become aware of a malicious MCP server, please it to our vulnerability disclosure program, and choose https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol as the Asset.

 

Taking Actions with Tools
Remote MCP servers give Claude tools it can invoke during your conversation. The developer of an MCP server can define what these tools do, including:

Reading data from connected applications.

Creating, modifying, or deleting data in connected applications.

Taking actions on behalf of the user.

Claude can only access resources that you've given the server permission to access, but you should:

Be aware of any actions Claude is taking and that they have no destructive or unintended effects.

Review Claude's tool approval requests carefully and only click "Allow always" when using a server and tool that you trust to run unsupervised.

Using the "Search and tools" menu, disable any tools that aren't relevant to the current conversation or that you don't want Claude to be able to invoke.

Using Claude with Research
Note: Advanced Research is not currently able to invoke tools from local MCP servers.

Research allows Claude to deeply investigate queries by searching through hundreds of internal and external sources. During the research process, Claude can invoke tools from your connectors automatically without further approval.

 

When using Research with custom connectors:

Disable any tools that can take write actions in external applications.

Review Claude’s approval request carefully and be aware of which tools you’re granting Claude permission to invoke.

Be mindful of the impact of Claude sending a large number of requests to your connectors.

See Using Research on Claude.ai for more information about this feature.

Building Custom Connectors via Remote MCP Servers
Updated today
Custom connectors using remote MCP are available on Claude and Claude Desktop for users on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.

Building Remote MCP Servers
To get started with remote servers, start with the following resources:

The auth spec, especially details on the auth flow for third-party services.

The remote server examples in the TypeScript and Python SDKs.

The client and server auth implementations in the TypeScript and Python SDKs.

The official MCP roadmap and draft spec’s changelog for details on how the protocol will evolve.

Other resources (like this) may also be helpful to learn about considerations when building, deploying, and troubleshooting remote servers.

 

In addition, some solutions like Cloudflare provide remote MCP server hosting with built-in autoscaling, OAuth token management, and deployment.

 

MCP Support
Platforms
Remote MCP servers are supported on Claude and Claude Desktop for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.

To configure remote MCP servers for use in Claude Desktop, add them via Settings > Connectors. Claude Desktop will not connect to remote servers that are configured directly via claude_desktop_config.json.

As of July, Claude for iOS and Android also support remote MCP servers!

Users can use tools, prompts, and resources from remote servers that they’ve already added via claude.ai. Users cannot add new servers directly from Claude Mobile.

Transport and Auth
Claude supports both SSE- and Streamable HTTP-based remote servers, although support for SSE may be deprecated in the coming months.

Claude supports both authless and OAuth-based remote servers.

Auth Support

Claude supports the 3/26 auth spec and (as of July) the 6/18 auth spec.

Claude supports Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

OAuth servers can signal to Claude that a DCR client has been deleted and that Claude should re-register the client by returning an HTTP 401 with an error of invalid_client from the token endpoint, as described in RFC 6749.

As of July, users are also able to specify a custom client ID and client secret when configuring a server that doesn’t support DCR.

Claude’s OAuth callback URL is https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback and its OAuth client name is Claude.

This callback URL may change to https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback in the future – if you choose to allowlist MCP client callback URLs, please allowlist this callback URL as well to ensure that your server continues to work with Claude.

Claude supports token expiry and refresh – servers should support this functionality in order to provide the best experience for users.

See here for the IP addresses used by Claude for inbound and outbound connections to MCP servers. Server developers wishing to disallow non-Claude MCP Clients can whitelist these IP addresses, Claude’s OAuth callback URL, and/or Claude’s OAuth client name.

 

Protocol Features
Claude supports tools, prompts, and resources.

Claude supports text- and image-based tool results.

Claude supports text- and binary- based resources.

Claude does not yet support resource subscriptions, sampling, and other more advanced or draft capabilities.

Testing Remote MCP Servers
The best way to test and validate a server is to try adding it to Claude. 

 

Alternatively, use the inspector tool. This will allow you to validate:

that your server successfully initiates and completes the auth flow.

that your server correctly implements various parts of the auth flow.

which tools, prompts, resources, and other MCP features your server exposes.

 


 

See the MCP documentation for more details on using inspector and for other tips on how to debug and troubleshoot your server.

 

In addition, other solutions like Cloudflare’s AI Playground allow you to test remote MCP server functionality.
