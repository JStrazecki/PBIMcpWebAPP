When I try to connect in claude.ai I get this information:
I can see this is an error message that reads:
"There was an error connecting to test. Please check your server details and ensure your server handles auth correctly."

two deployments ago I could see message successfully connected but I couldnt see the tools and it was disconecting me again.
